Description
-----------
The plugin displays a list of OSD-Messages shown since VDR start-up.
To avoid flooding the history with periodic messages, like shutdown
announcements, messages matching a user-defined pattern (regular
expression) can be excluded from being recorded in the history.


Note to Translators
-------------------
If you translate this plugin to your language, please do so in creating

sub-directory after compiling the plugin.
